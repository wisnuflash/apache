## To install MySQL 5.7 on Ubuntu 22.04, you’ll need to follow these steps since Ubuntu 22.04 doesn’t include MySQL 5.7 by default. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Step 1: Add the MySQL APT Repository
Download the MySQL APT repository package:

```python
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.24-1_all.deb
```
Install the repository package:

```python
sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.24-1_all.deb
```
During installation, select MySQL 5.7 when prompted.

Update the package list:

```python
sudo apt update
```

check mysql5.7 package :
```python
sudo apt-cache policy mysql-server
```
### The GPG error indicates that the public key for the MySQL repository is missing, which prevents the package manager from verifying the repository. To resolve this, you’ll need to add the public key manually. Here’s how:

Download the Public Key:

Run the following command to fetch the missing key directly from MySQL’s repository:

```python
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys B7B3B788A8D3785C
```
This command adds the public key to your system’s keyring.

Update the Package List Again:

After adding the key, update the package list:

```pytho
sudo apt update
```
### Step 2: Install MySQL 5.7
Now, install MySQL 5.7:
```python
sudo apt install -f mysql-client=5.7* mysql-community-server=5.7* mysql-server=5.7*
```
### Step 3: Verify Installation
Check the MySQL version to confirm it's 5.7:

```python
mysql --version
```
